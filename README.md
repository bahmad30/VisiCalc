# VisiCalc
VisiCalc is a Microsoft Excel-esque spreadsheet program. The user can use this program to store data, program spreadsheet cells, save (and open previously saved) spreadsheets, and much more.

"VisiCalc(1)" contains the main class for VisiCalc. The rest of the files are subclasses which are essential for the program to function properly.
