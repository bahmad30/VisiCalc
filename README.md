# VisiCalc
VisiCalc is a (fairly robust) Microsoft Excel-esque spreadsheet program made with Java. The user can use this program to store data, program spreadsheet cells, save (and open previously saved) spreadsheets, and much more.

"VisiCalc(1)" contains the main class for VisiCalc. The rest of the files are subclasses that are essential for proper functioning of the program.
